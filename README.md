### Fundamentals of Search engines and text processing.

I've been reading about search engines (for example Lucene) and how they perform search very fast.
This is to demystify the basic data structures and concepts behind the concept of search at an absolute beginner level.

I'm not intending to re-implement Lucene or invent any new Algorithm. This is rather simply practice and feel the important concepts behind the search engines.
